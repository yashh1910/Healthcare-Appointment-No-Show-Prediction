 ```E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis```

 📌 Objective

To identify key reasons why customers return products and how return rates vary across:

 Product Categories
 Regions/Locations
 Customer Demographics (Age, Gender)
 Marketing/Payment/Shipping Channels

And to predict which orders are likely to be returned using machine learning.

 🛠 Tools Used

 **Python** (Data Cleaning, Logistic Regression Prediction)
 **Power BI** (Interactive Dashboard)
 **Pandas, Scikit-Learn** (Python Libraries)

📉 Data Analysis Performed

  Return % by Category
  Return % by Gender
  Return % by Age Group
  Return % by Region
  Return % by Payment Method
  Return % by Shipping Method

All results were exported to CSV for use in Power BI dashboard.

 🤖 Machine Learning (Python)

👉 Model Used:

Logistic Regression (Supervised Classification)

👉Target:

Predict whether an order will be **Returned** or **Not Returned**

👉 Output:

high_risk_products.csv with **predicted return probability** for each order


 📊 Power BI Dashboard

Dashboard Name: E-commerce Product Return Risk Dashboard

 👉Key Visuals:

 Category-wise Return %
 Gender-wise Return % (Donut)
 Region-wise Returns (Bar/Map)
 Age Group vs Returns (Line Chart)
 Return % by Payment Method
 Return % by Shipping Method
 High-Risk Products Table**

 👉Interactivity:
